    description: >
      This module provides functionality for routing interrupts and registering handlers for traps,
      controlling the system timer, and managing timed events.
      The BSP provides a base trap handler.  Running the initialisation function csi_interrupts_init will
      put the address of this handler in the mtvec register.  This base trap handler provides default
      exception handling, and calls any handlers registered by the user.
      Systems using RVM-CSI may provide their own trap handling
      support, in which case csi_interrupts_init should not be called, and all functions in this module
      will be inoperative.
    notes:
      - There will be at most one instance of the trap handling and interrupt subsystem per hart.
      - >
        The base trap handler will attempt to inform users of unhandled exceptions via the RVM-CSI console
        API.  Other unhandled interrupts will be ignored.
